    <h1 align="center"><em>Beware of password hackers and crackers!</em></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If the security breach
        at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group milworm didn't convince you of their
        capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a, a resident of
        www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail
        in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone
        else on the Net for more such accounts!
        Surprised? Or scared?
